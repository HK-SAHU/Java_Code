//100% abstraction is achieved when all the methods are abstract method
// if any there is any method in the parent class whose body and implemnetation is hidden is has to be declared as abstract
// if there is even single abstract method in the class, then the class has to be declared as abstract class
// when we use abstract it means we are not using the implentation of that method anywhere, that's why we make that abstract
// or we can say that the method is overriden in it's all child classes then we can make that method abstract
// implemantation of these methods are given in there child classes
// we can make the refrence(variable) of the ABSTRACT CLASS   
// we cannot make the object of the abstract class because the abstract class is incomplete, it donot have the body or the methods in it are imcomplete     
// if have methods which have some body then we are not achieving the 100% abstraction  -> interface ka concept ayege isme
